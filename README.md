# Bikesharing
Using tableau to analyze bikeshare data in NYC

##Project Overview
Investment in the bike rental business is worthy of analysis prior to making that decision.  Data from NYC is being utilized as a basis to understand the key performance indicators of a successful business for a new customer.  Critical parameters to evalutate rental characteristics such as number of trips, trip duration, popular rental times, and how long they are rented for.  The month of August was chosen to make this assessment from.

##Resources 
Data is pulled from the Citibikenyc web page - https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data.  Their system also has downloadable flatfile trip histories for individual use and analysis.  https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip was the datset selected from 2019 to establish a baseline.

Tableau Public Free Edition was selected for the dashboard preparation.

## Analysis:
Utilizing tableau visualizations were generated for the following categories:  trip/trip duration,peak use hours, and breakouts by gender.  The database has a total of 2344224 rows of data under 15 column headdings for the month.  Details of eavh of the graphics are shown below.

Demographics lean to the male gender, but this analysis is impacted by a large number of users that did not specify gender.  The peak trip duration occurs in a bin from 5-6 hours duration.  The most popular time for riding is Thursday 5-7pm but this can easily be influenced by cycling groups with regular meeting times and durations.

## Summary?  

Based on the NYC data, there is support for an investment in the bike sharing business.  With that said, to further investigate before making a final decision, the following questions/additional information need to be considered:
*  What does the overall business perform on an annual basis.  With the dataset being NYC, is there a seasonal effect.
*  For the target location:
  - How active is the cycling community in this location?
  - Does the community support cycling trails or other safe biking options?
  - Considering the NYC data, if seasonality, will this relate to the area being considered? Longer or shorter cold seasons.
  - What does the rental bike options entail?  Recreational user versus traveling cyclists choosing to rent at their destination.
